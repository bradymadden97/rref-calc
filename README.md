# RREF Calculator
This tool can be used in linear algebra to convert a matrix to its echelon or reduced row echelon form. The purpose behind building this tool was to aid linear algebra students in tedious problem sets that involve large amounts of simple arithmetic by automatically reducing the matrix to its simplest form. There already exists row reduction calculators on the web, but I wanted to attempt to build my own.

## Getting Started
To easily use the RREF Calculator locally on your machine, I took advantage of the built-in web server in PHP 5.4.

First clone the repo to your computer using the command terminal
'''git clone https://github.com/bradymadden97/rref-calc

Now open a local PHP server on your machine with this command
'''php -S localhost:8000

Open a web browser and enter the following into the navigation bar
'''localhost:8000

Enjoy!
